# This YAML file defines a static pod configuration for an NGINX server.
# Static pods are managed directly by the kubelet on a specific node, 
# rather than through the Kubernetes API server. This is useful for 
# critical system pods or for debugging purposes.
# The pod definition includes a single container running the NGINX image.
# The location for creating static pod manifests is /etc/kubernetes/manifests in node.
# The kubelet will automatically detect and manage static pods defined in this directory.
